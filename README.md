Mouse Controller Using Hand Gestures

🚀**Introduction**

This project aims to create a **virtual mouse controller** that uses **hand gestures** captured by a webcam. Instead of a physical mouse, users can control the cursor, click, and scroll using specific hand movements. This is a great example of **human-computer interaction** and computer vision applications.

✨ **Features**

  * **Cursor Movement:** Move your hand to move the mouse cursor.
  * **Clicking:** Perform a gesture (e.g., closing your fist) to simulate a left-click.
  * **Scrolling:** Use a specific gesture (e.g., two fingers up or down) to scroll.
  * **Customizable Gestures:** Easily modify and add new gestures.
  * **User-Friendly Interface:** The system provides feedback to the user.

💻 **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

  * **Python 3.x:** The project is written in Python.
  * **Pip:** Python's package installer.
  * **A Webcam:** A functioning webcam is required to capture hand movements.

🛠️ **Installation**

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <https://github.com/Rahulb1123/Mouse-Controller-using-hand-gesture.git>
    ```

2.  **Install the required libraries:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    *Note: The `requirements.txt` file should contain all the necessary libraries like **OpenCV**, **Mediapipe**, **PyAutoGUI**, etc.*

## 🏃‍♀️ **How to Run**

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the project's main directory.
3.  Run the main script:
    ```bash
    python cal.py
    ```
4.  The webcam feed will open, and you can start using hand gestures to control your mouse.
